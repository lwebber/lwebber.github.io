I grew up surrounded by computers. My dad was a self-employed software engineer in the 80s (pre-Windows) and we had a behemoth of a TRS-80 on our dining room table. He coded in PASCAL and COBOL and would start compilation of his programs before dinner so they'd be ready after dinner. My brother had 3 different video game consoles and his own computer as well. I read a lot of books, wrote poetry, acted in plays, played volleyball and softball, but I never touched a computer during those years. Why? I'm not sure. I'm not aware of any particular message that told me girls don't fiddle with computers. I think it's just one of those things-- as a kid, if your friends aren't doing it, you don't get particularly interested in it. The closest I came to technology was a typing class in high school. Not 'keyboarding' on computers-- actual typing on typewriters. With ribbons and correction tape.

I came out of college with an English degree and even went to grad school to get a PhD in English (one try--left with a Master's) and another try at a PhD in Arts & Humanities education (left academia-- too brutal). I moved on to teaching high school English and at some point, it became clear to me that laptops on the classroom were going to be revolutionary. As an English teacher, I incorporated message boards (remember Delphi forums?) and digital storytelling techniques into my curriculum. The passion I felt around Educational Technology led to a job as an Ed Tech integrator at a school that also needed a Computer Science teacher. When asked if I could do it, I said, audaciously, "Sure, I can teach myself anything."
> "Sure, I can teach myself anything."

This was a bold statement, for sure, but I did it. I taught myself the AP Computer Science curriculum (Java) (not without several months, maybe even two years, of pulling my hair out) and I can say now that it is one of my professional accomplishments I am most proud of. I said I could do something, set out to do it, and I did it. Even though I was "just an English major".

In that process, I came to love code. I mean, really love it. I had no idea! I had no idea I would ponder problems in my sleep and awake with solutions. I had no idea that I would come to understand what is meant by "elegance" in code and truly appreciate its aesthetics. I became fascinated with the similaries between English grammar and code grammar. All of it swirled together as poetry in my mind.

As the world of education changed, and schools became more competitive and teachers more stressed, I knew it was time for me to leave and focus on other options for my professional life. I took a simple office job at a meditation center and one day found myself obsessing about a problem our Development Manager was having with a data set. I knew the algorithm that could give her what she wanted. This experience reminded me that I love to solve problems and I love to help people out. It's in me.
